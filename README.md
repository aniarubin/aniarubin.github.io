One evening I decided to make a mural of my favorite rock and metal bands.

Can I play with madness? Give me the sense to wonder

I collected inspirations.

And so the adventure began!

I chose a mix of typography and Hipgnosis album covers. It had to look cool.

And all you touch and all you see Is all your life will ever be

I worked days and nights.

What a cursed idea!

Breathe, breathe in the air, Don't be afraid to care...

My hand, covered in black acrylic paint was going to fall off! Really.

Finally, at four in the morning I collapsed on my bed, admiring the view.

I have the coolest bedroom wall in Tel Aviv.

Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin.. - all the great ones are here.

And now you see it in CSS Grid. This whole gallery is a grid of columns and rows. You can create cool layouts with just few lines of code. How amazing is that.

All in all you're just another brick in the wall.
